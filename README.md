Unless you want to hire me, or I sent this repository as a portfolio, there's nothing good here. Go away.

Everything here (except this README) is in brazilian portuguese.

Code related stuff I made in IFRO. IFRO means "Instuto Federal de Rondônia", where I did my high school. 2019-2021 class.
I was deleting some stuff from my computer and noticed I never backed-up my homework. Hosting here is better than just keeping it in my computer. Good stuff to show off.

All of the devops files (that I will add eventually, I have to double check some stuff) were made in C#, and some with WPF. Made with Visual Studio 2019. PW stands for Programação Web, web dev, made with Visual Studio Code. Databases uses SQL, made with MySQL workbench.
Some of my other repositories are stuff I made in high school. They are better than most of the code here. They are not included here.

Since this is pretty much everything relevant I made in high school (coding related), I want to thank my friends that supported me emotionally through high school, especially during the pandemic. It was a lot less painful experience thanks to you!
